                    <p>Well, here is a little introduction about myself. I am 27 years old. I live in Draper, UT with my wife Kellie, and our 1.5 year old boy, Lennon. My wife and I have been married for 3.5 years now. We got married in the Salt Lake Temple</p>

                    <h2>Work</h2>
                    <p>I work full-time and go to school full-time. So life is busy. I'm free anytime after 6PM weekdays. I am the web manager for a company in Salt Lake called Rize Point. I have been working there for about 2 months now. And before that I was a front-end developer for a security company in Salt Lake called, Peak Alarm. I have been doing front-end development for about 5 years now. In that time I have learned a lot. There have been a lot of exciting new technologies brought to the front-end side that are really fun and cool.</p>

                    <p>I am a Computer Science major, with an emphasis in web development. I'm working to be more of a backend developer. I think after I graduate I would like to be a backend developer or a full stack developer. That's future Travis' problem though.</p>
